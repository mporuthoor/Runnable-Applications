The Budget Widget application was designed to show me on my home screen the amount of "Dining Dollars" I could spend
each day and through the end of the week without running out of money in my meal plan by the end of the semester. Since
it was a personal app that I had no intention of releasing to the public, it requires manual updates to stay accurate
and I hard coded the date of the end of the semester into the code of the app so anyone using it today will be shown a
negative amount that they can spend each day and week no matter what amount they input as their remaining budget. If
this widget interests you and you know your way around Android Studio, you can clone the repository at the link below
and modify the end date on line 75 of MainActivity.java to whatever you want the end date to be. Even though I call it
Budget Widget based on the generic use cases, the name of the app in the source code is Meal Plan Widget. If you want
to change that you can go to line 2 of strings.xml and update the value of the "app_name" string.

A compiled debug version of this app (with the end date hard coded to 11/16/2018) can be found at the following link:
