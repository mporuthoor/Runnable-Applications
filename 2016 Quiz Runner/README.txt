This application is an educational game made with Unity3D as my senior year submission to the 2016 FBLA State (Georgia)
and National Leadership Conferences for the Computer Game and Simulation Programming Event. It is a simple maze game
with questions incorporated to guide the player to the end if they answer the questions correctly. It starts with a
tutorial that explains the rules and mechanics of the game and teaches the controls so the game is easier to
understand. To run this game, download the contents of this folder to your computer and double click the
"QuizRunner.exe" file.
