This app doesn't collect any user data. The only data it accesses is whatever file/files you are sending or receiving. When sending, it reads the files to be sent and sends the data in pieces to your router which sends it to the other device on your network using the app. When receiving, it reads the data coming from the other device through the router and assembles it into a file in your downloads folder. At no point in this process is any data saved by anyone not explicitly receiving the data. The data never actually leaves your local network which is why it isn't encrypted in transit. It is not recommended to use this application to send sensitive files on public Wi-Fi networks because anyone with the technical knowledge and a packet sniffer can take some time and piece your file together themselves. If you want to know how exactly this app works and can understand Java Android applications, feel free to look at the source code at https://github.com/mporuthoor/FileTransferGUI.
