FileTransferGUI

This folder contains runnable files for the FileTransferGUI desktop application.
You can run these on any computer with Python installed.
If you're not a programmer, you can just download the "FileTransferGUI.exe" file and double click to run it. If you
want to run it from the command line or edit the functionality somehow, you can download the "FileTransferGUI.py" file.

This program can send and receive files to other devices with the FileTransferGUI Android or desktop application on the
same local network. While the Android version saves files to the Downloads folder, the desktop version saves downloaded
files in whatever folder the runner is in. The flow of the program can be viewed in the "Desktop.jpg" file. The first
time the program is run it will ask for permission to run on public and private networks. It is recommended to use this
application on private networks. This program is designed for fast file transfer on secure home networks so no
encryption is used. If you use this program to send sensitive files on a public network, someone on the network can use
a packet sniffer to piece together the file you are sending.
