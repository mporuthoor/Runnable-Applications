This application is a simple game made with Construct2 as my junior year submission to the 2015 Georgia FBLA State
Leadership Conference for the Computer Game and Simulation Programming Event. It qualified for nationals but I ended up
picking a different event to compete in for the National Conference. In this game you play as a personified antivirus
software that shoots CDs at worms from alien hackers that have infected multiple devices on your network. You work your
way through the network and rid each device of the worms until the network is free of thee worm and the internet is
safe. The storytelling and technical accuracy of the game are not the best but it is somewhat fun to play.
Unfortunately, I never actually displayed the passwords to unlock access to each level and I have long since forgot
them so any time you close the game you'll lose all progress you've made. To run this game, download the folder for
your operating system and then either double click the "malwarebitsthegame.exe" file to run the game in Windows or
double click "malwarebitsthegame.app" to install the game on Mac.
