The OpenDownload Chrome extension was designed to make it easier to access videos from some online players without
opening a dozen pop-up ads. Please keep in mind that this was made during the online streaming era of Openload (hence
the name) and Streamango and it was made to work on players of that era. Using it today is unlikely to yield the same
results as many players have rightly upgraded their security to keep people from directly accessing their video files
and downloading them. At the time it seemed only fair to allow non-programmers to access video links since many people
familiar with computer science were already able to do so easily. Extensions like mine made getting direct links more
accessible and I appreciate that many streaming sites' response to this was to make it more difficult for everyone to
access video links in this manner. I think that in some ways the internet is a more secure place than it was in 2018
and I appreciate companies taking data security more seriously. For this reason I have no intention of making an
updated version of this extension. However if you still want to try it out and see if it works, you can go to the first
link below to install the extension on any Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.). If you are
interested in web development and want to see how simple it was to access direct video links five years ago, you can go
to the second link and take a look at the source code.
