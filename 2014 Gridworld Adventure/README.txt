This application is a simple game made with Construct2 as my sophomore year final project for my AP Computer Science
class. Some of the monsters and obstacles in the game are taken from the Gridworld Case Study from the free response
questions on the AP Exam for the class. The game does have loud music so I recommend turning down or muting the volume
on your computer before running the application. This game is designed to be tricky and there are many ways to die that
you may not see coming so don't be discouraged if you have to replay each level a few times before you beat them. A
perfect score on the level means that you killed every monster and boss in the level without taking ant damage. Do not
aim to get the highest percent on every level or you may need to replay each level several times. This game does not
save your progress so if you close the application you will have to start over from the beginning. To run this game,
download the folder for your operating system and then either double click the "gridworldadventure.exe" file to run the
game in Windows or double click "gridworldadventure.app" to install the game on Mac.
